10:31 AM:
Finally, making my first post! I've been fairly preoccupied between my courseload, work, getting some CS work lined up for the summer and trying to continue doing the things I enjoy. The last month, I've spent way too much time on the non-academic things I enjoy. I've gotten really into chess. Since February I've climbed from 800 to 1200, but the last month, I've been playing 40 hours each week. I'd have games going while I did homework, and spent way too much of my "free time" playing. It lead me to become careless with my studies, and I got a really bad score on a Physics exam. Because of this, I've restricted chess to a maximum of 2 hours on any given day and have set myself to getting back into the things that I've let go of in pursuit of developing as a chess player. Glad to be back! 

I've written a fairly simple algorithm for a class, and for fun I wrote a function to measure the runtime of that algorithm. Currently, I'm assigning myself the creation of a Spanish Study tool. This would involve creating a chache of words that I can come back to when I run the function, a function to add words to the known vocabulary, and a function to generate sentences based upon some simple structures. What I'm interested is how much data per verb needs to be stored. I think you have a function that if regular x (present, past, imperfect, imperfect past, etc.), would apply the standard conjugations accordingly. When not, you just have to type those things themselves. I think as part as creating the verb object, you pass in a list of Booleans describing the regularity of the verb. 

Perhaps there are also irregular singular to plural changes too for nouns, and some function needs to be written accordingly for that. There's also the case where there is no plural version of the noun, like Psychology. There's no multiple psychologies. Perhaps denote that by capitalizing the first letter in the sentence? I plan to spend my day creating a strong foundation such that I can start adding every word in my textbook. 

Maybe I start with some base data and add from there. That way, I don't have to add every word on its own. I'll think more and get something started in the afternoon
